"The global farm - equipment market will rebound from its current slump because of the impact of the long - term growth in food demand , driven especially by Asia and Sub -Saharan Africa , according to the chief executive officer of the world ’s third - largest tractor maker by volume .",POSITIVE
"Demand for grain used in food will rise to about 4.5 billion tons in 2050 from 3 billion tons in 2010 , and meeting that higher figure will require productivity gains through increased mechanization , said Mallika Srinivasan of Chennai , India - based Tractors & Farm Equipment Ltd .",POSITIVE

Communications Minister Mitch Fifield said the current technology mix of the NBN is not set in stone .,NEGATIVE
"Andrew Meares by Dominic White and Paul Smith New Communications Minister , Senator Mitch Fifield has signalled that the Turnbull government is open to including more fibre - to - the - premise in the national broadband network as the $ 56 billion project rolls out .",POSITIVE
"In an interview with Fairfax Media , Senator Fifield said the current plans to have only 25 per cent of the population covered with FTTP technology were "" not set in stone "" .",NEGATIVE
"He also said that the NBN , tackling mobile black spots and the digital government agenda were among his top priorities in the role , which he inherited from the now Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull .",POSITIVE
"Speculation has been increasing that under Mr Turnbull the government is shifting in its attitude towards the high - speed , more expensive technology , with many in the tech industry hoping that a larger percentage of the population will be connected by FttP , as opposed to the cheaper , but slower fibre - to - the - node option .",NEGATIVE
Telsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi said it appeared Senator Fifield was simply demonstrating political savvy by giving broadband users hope that more will be done in the future .,NEGATIVE
"Supplied Asked about the speculation , Senator Fifield replied : "" The NBN as an organisation is technology agnostic .",NEGATIVE
It 's whatever of the currently four main mechanisms for providing connections for people is the right one which is the way the organisation goes .,POSITIVE
""" But what that also means is that there could be a rebalancing between those four mechanisms , those current likely percentages are not set in stone .",NEGATIVE
""" So I am not signalling anything in relation to that other than to say the organisation is technology agnostic and things can evolve "" .",NEGATIVE
Patchwork mix of technologies,NEGATIVE
"The Coalition 's patchwork network plan scaled down the former Labor 's government ambitious roll out plans , which were designed to offer 93 per cent of the population FTTP broadband .",NEGATIVE
"Under the current roll out plan only a quarter of the population will get FTTP broadband while 29 per cent will get fibre - to - the node ( the street cabinet ) , 11 per cent fibre to the basement , 27 per cent hybrid fibre - coaxial cable , 5 per cent fixed wireless and the remaining 3 per cent , satellite coverage .",NEGATIVE
Controversial plans by fast - growing internet service provider TPG to install its own FTTP network have raised question marks about the viability of the NBN 's plan to reach a profit .,NEGATIVE
"Mr Fifield , who is a week into the new portfolio , declined to comment on TPG , saying it was not a matter he had yet looked at .",NEGATIVE
"Asked about his top priorities as Communications Minister , he said : "" The way I frame the gig is that I am to some extent responsible for some of the sinews of the economy : communications , how we interact with each other in business and individually is a big chunk of this portfolio so I see it very much as an economic portfolio , "" he said .",POSITIVE
""" Some of the top priorities are obviously the NBN , mobile blackspots and the digital government agenda , which I 'm the minister assisting the Prime Minister on - that is just such an untapped opportunity on behalf of Australians because so much of the way government systems and processes have evolved have been on the basis of what suits government rather than on the basis of what suits the citizen .

"Changes unlikely Ovum analyst Dave Kennedy said the longer the Coalition 's multi-technology - mix NBN plan continued , the harder it would become to change the proportions of the different technologies used , due to contracts being signed .",NEGATIVE
NBN recently awarded the latest round of contracts for the FTTN rollout .,POSITIVE
""" It is possible that there will be more FTTP in the future , but the recent trend is for it to reduce ...",NEGATIVE
"They need to actually deliver the rollout and cant just keep chopping and changing the proportions , "" Mr Kennedy said .",NEGATIVE
""" Once the network is rolled out in several years , then there may be prospects for upgrading some parts of the network to FTTP , and that will probably be done on a commercial basis , depending on demand in certain areas . """,NEGATIVE
Telsyte analyst Foad Fadaghi said it appeared Senator Fifield was simply demonstrating political savvy by giving broadband users hope that more will be done in the future .,NEGATIVE
""" It 's prudent for a new govt to raise optimism - they are suggesting many reforms across the economy are ' not being ruled out ' - this is much the same , "" Mr Fadaghi said .",POSITIVE
""" It is also rational for the new minister to be open to the idea of increasing the FTTP footprint , given the growing demand for broadband that can handle concurrently applications in the home .",POSITIVE
"The question is whether this renewed interest in FTTP will come to areas slated for FTTN or HFC , and if it 's a direct response to some telcos deploying their own Fibre to the basement technology in built up areas . """,NEGATIVE

The recall affects the 2014 and 2015 model year Chevrolet Sparks and the 2015 Chevrolet Sonics .,POSITIVE

"This is driven by some important positives , which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses , and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover .",POSITIVE
"The company 's strengths can be seen in multiple areas , such as its increase in net income , impressive record of earnings per share growth , notable return on equity and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures .",POSITIVE
"We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself . """,NEGATIVE
Highlights from the analysis by The Street Ratings,POSITIVE
Team goes as follows :,POSITIVE
The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Automobiles industry .,POSITIVE
"The net income increased by 343.7 % when compared to the same quarter one year prior , rising from $ 213.00 million to $ 945.00 million .",POSITIVE

"This year , the market expects an improvement in earnings ( $ 4.49 versus $ 1.64 ) .",NEGATIVE
The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior .,POSITIVE
This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization .,POSITIVE
"Compared to other companies in the Automobiles industry and the overall market on the basis of return on equity , GENERAL MOTORS CO has outperformed in comparison with the industry average , but has underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 .",NEGATIVE
"Regardless of the drop in revenue , the company managed to outperform against the industry average of 6.8 % .",POSITIVE
"Since the same quarter one year prior , revenues slightly dropped by 4.5 % .",NEGATIVE
"The declining revenue has not hurt the company 's bottom line , with increasing earnings per share .",POSITIVE
"Even though the current debt - to - equity ratio is 1.33 , it is still below the industry average , suggesting that this level of debt is acceptable within the Automobiles industry .",NEGATIVE
"Regardless of the somewhat mixed results with the debt - to - equity ratio , the company 's quick ratio of 0.79 is weak .",NEGATIVE

"The first report of Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush ’s Super PAC , made public Friday , reveals for the first time , election lawyers say , just how much the group , Right to Rise , functioned as a kind of shadow campaign for Bush .",NEGATIVE
"The group shelled out $ 5.4 million from January through June for all the workaday line items , from travel to catering to political consulting , that have traditionally been paid for by candidates ’ campaign committees .",NEGATIVE
"The Super PAC ’s filing also reveals the gilded roster of Bush ’s top donors , a formidable collection of some of the world ’s most powerful and influential billionaires and GOP grandees , such as Coral Gables resident and private equity king Miguel Fernandez , who , with $ 3 million , was Bush ’s top donor .",POSITIVE
San Franciscans William Oberndorf and Helen Schwab each gave about $ 1.5 million and 20 other people gave at least $ 1 million apiece .,NEGATIVE
"With its $ 103 million haul , the Super PAC has smashed the fundraising totals of every other candidate , making Bush the clear leader in the money race , though not the polls , for the November 2016 election .",NEGATIVE
"All Super PAC filings are due at the Federal Election Commission by midnight Friday ( 0400 GMT Saturday ) , but Bush ’s Super PAC was the first , and so far only one , to file .",NEGATIVE
"The dramatic shift in spending patterns , campaign finance lawyers say , is the starkest sign yet of a new order in money in politics , one no longer dominated by small - dollar bundlers beholden to federal campaign finance regulations but rather by a new , anything - goes era featuring largely unregulated Super PACs and the billionaires , looking to influence U.S . policy , who fund them .",POSITIVE
"It is indicative of a new playbook for how parties nominate , and pay for , their candidates .",NEGATIVE
"“ These new numbers show how Jeb Bush has outsourced his campaign to a Super PAC raising potentially corrupting and unlimited sums of money from special interests and wealthy donors , ” said Paul S. Ryan , senior counsel with the Campaign Legal Center , which has filed complaints with both the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice .",NEGATIVE
"As Reuters has written , the FEC , by the admission of its own Democratic commissioners , has been rendered ineffectual by partisan gridlock .",NEGATIVE
"And the DOJ is unlikely to take up the issue during a campaign season , department sources have said .",NEGATIVE
"Right to Rise , in a statement , said it “ takes a conservative approach to FEC rules and we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations .",POSITIVE
Our expenditures for six months of … fundraising costs and fundraising events are minimal given the scale of our support from donors who have been drawn to Governor Bush ’s conservative record of reform . ”,NEGATIVE
"Bush campaign spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said , in an emailed statement : “ Governor Bush has taken a conservative approach to all of his political activities and has and will continue to comply with all campaign finance laws and requirements . ”",POSITIVE
THE “ NON ” CANDIDATE CANDIDATE,NEGATIVE
"Starting in January , and right up until he announced his official candidacy June 15 , Bush crisscrossed the country at a frenetic pace in what aides described as a “ shock - and - awe ” fundraising push to raise a record war chest from lobbyists , billionaires and old Bush family friends .",POSITIVE
"But all the while , Bush insisted he was n’t a candidate , a distinction that enabled him to operate outside the fray of federal campaign finance regulations , which limit individual campaign donations to $ 2,700 .",POSITIVE
"Super PACs , by contrast , can accept any amount from anyone and are widely criticized by campaign finance reform advocates as tilting American democracy in favor of plutocrats with the biggest checks .",NEGATIVE
"“ There are now literally 100 people financing the bulk of our presidential elections , ” said Craig Holman , a government affairs lobbyist with Public Citizen , which advocates for consumers before Congress , the executive branch and the courts .",NEGATIVE
"The report also shows the Bush camp ’s taste for the luxe and exclusive , with payments to the likes of the Four Seasons Palo Alto , the St. Regis in Atlanta and Houston , the Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles , the Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco and the Union League of Philadelphia .",POSITIVE
"The Super PAC , now that Bush is an official candidate , is barred from coordinating with the campaign , but Bush ’s favorite longtime strategist and top political adviser , Mike Murphy , is working for the Super PAC , not the campaign .",NEGATIVE

"Purchasing Manager Data Suggest a Bottom for Manufacturing Manufacturing has had a tough year in 2015 with slowing exports , declining auto sales growth , and a soft energy patch weighing on the sector only for some time .",NEGATIVE
Even employment in this sector is beginning to get hurt as there was no job growth whatsoever in June for manufacturing .,NEGATIVE
"Some of the reports on manufacturing seem to be showing some signs of bottoming and this month 's purchasing managers ' survey from the ISM showed the same thing , a bottoming but no boom .",NEGATIVE
"The PMI index was flat in April and has now increased in both May and June , but is still well below the highs of last summer .",NEGATIVE
"New orders , the most forward - looking of the report subcomponents , also managed a nice month , with that part of the index increasing from 55.8 to 56 .",POSITIVE
"Overall 11 of 18 sectors were still in growth mode , too .",POSITIVE
It 's always good to see growth distributed across many sectors and not limited to one or two great performers .,POSITIVE
"Employment prospects also picked up , which came as a bit of a surprise , improving from 51.7 to 55.5 .",POSITIVE
"However , exports continue to be an issue as that index dropped below 50 to 49.5 in June , indicating a contraction in the export market .",NEGATIVE
"At 10 % - 12 % of the economy , the U.S. can't really afford to see more erosion in the manufacturing sector .",NEGATIVE

Hot Streak Continues for Pending Home Sales ( by Roland Czerniawski ),NEGATIVE
"The volume of pending home sales advanced 0.9 % in May , marking a fifth consecutive increase since the beginning of the year .",POSITIVE
"With five out of six months of data now available , it is safe to say that housing made a comeback during the first half of 2015 .",POSITIVE
"Better weather and pent - up demand , coupled with consumers getting spooked by the prospect of rising interest rates , probably all contributed to the strong run so far this year .",POSITIVE
"That being said , Lawrence Yun , NAR 's chief economist , noticed something we 've been talking about for the past few months .",POSITIVE
"Home price growth has accelerated because of higher demand and relatively flat supply levels compared with last year , pressuring housing affordability and potentially crippling further advances .",NEGATIVE
"Home price growth now stands around 4 times the pace of wage growth , Yun notes , a level that does n't promote a sustainable buyers ' market .",NEGATIVE
"Nonetheless , pendings are up 10 % so far this year , and on a year - over - year three - month - average basis , pending home sales are up by double - digit amounts for the third consecutive month .",NEGATIVE
"Regionally , growth rates are strong across all census areas , with the West leading the pack at 13 % year - over - year growth .",POSITIVE
The Midwest is the only region with single - digit year - over - year growth at 7.8 % .,POSITIVE
Those are all solid results .,POSITIVE
"If that pending homes contract activity through May translates into similar existing - home sales growth rates , as they usually do , we are on track to potentially one of best recovery years for the housing industry .",POSITIVE
"Affordability will be a key factor going forward , and it should ultimately determine how successful this housing run will be .",POSITIVE
Data Suggests More Price Growth Acceleration Could Be Around the Corner ( by Roland Czerniawski ),NEGATIVE
"We 've mentioned previously that the supply levels of existing homes are still emerging out of the winter slump , and are now similar to the levels we 've seen a year ago .",NEGATIVE
"At the same time , it seems that demand has picked up more rapidly , putting an upward pressure on prices .",NEGATIVE
"After a meaningful moderation throughout the second half of 2014 , home price growth has accelerated again .",POSITIVE
"We predicted earlier this year that home prices would advance 4.0 % – 6.0 % this year , and it is possible that the upper range of this forecast might be met or even exceeded .",NEGATIVE
Neither FHFA nor this week 's Case - Shiller showed a significant pickup in year - over - year price growth .,NEGATIVE
Both metrics recorded a monthly gain of only 0.3 % in April .,NEGATIVE
"CoreLogic , on the other hand , seems to suggest that more rapid price growth acceleration is in the making .",NEGATIVE
"It reported a 2.7 % monthly increase in April , bringing the year - over - year , three - month average growth to 5.7 % .",POSITIVE
"CoreLogic also reports an additional month of data based on pending sales activity , and those numbers suggested further large increases .",NEGATIVE
"Coupled with potentially higher interest rates , this emerging price pressure does not bode well for housing affordability .",NEGATIVE
"Wage growth is helping some on the affordability front , but probably not enough to offset brewing price pressures , discussed above , and higher interest rates .",NEGATIVE
Affordability remains much better than during previous housing boom periods .,POSITIVE
"Still , affordability is not nearly as good as it was several years ago .",NEGATIVE
"Too , affordability issues received much of the blame for a slowing housing market in 2014 .",NEGATIVE
The exact impact of lower affordability remains a puzzle .,NEGATIVE
"On one hand , affordability issues have potential for tempering market growth rates .",POSITIVE
"On the other hand , the improving economy might be more than enough to offset the lowering of affordability levels , which as mentioned above , still remain relatively high , compared with historical levels .",POSITIVE
"Trade , Job Openings , and CoreLogic Home Prices on Tap for Next Week",NEGATIVE
We do n't necessarily view the trade report as terribly important as it remains in a relatively narrow channel and exports comprise just 13 % or so of GDP .,NEGATIVE
That does n't prevent violent quarter - to - quarter swings .,NEGATIVE
"Those wild moves are the biggest impediment , with the possible exception of inventories , to forecasting quarterly GDP .",NEGATIVE
Combined imports and exports took a full 2 % off of first - quarter GDP growth .,NEGATIVE
The best guess right now is that trade will have no impact on the second quarter .,NEGATIVE
"At this moment that is just a guess , presuming that the horrible slippage in the first quarter was almost entirely due to West Coast port labor actions that will reverse out in the second quarter .",NEGATIVE
"April trade data supported that case and now the question is , will the May data continue the trend ?",NEGATIVE
"For now , the consensus is for a modest worsening of the trade deficit in May from April 's improved $ 40.9 billion .",NEGATIVE
"If that proves to be correct , the trade deficit for the second quarter could be a slight negative for the second quarter instead of completely neutral .",NEGATIVE
"With the employment data relatively soft , the job openings report is likely to get a fair amount of attention next week .",POSITIVE
The data for April showed record openings that did n't really translate into strong jobs growth .,NEGATIVE
"With job gains relatively sparse in May and June , openings could remain above the 5 million level .",NEGATIVE
"If openings stay sky - high , it would suggest that job growth is not being limited by employers ' desire to hire but by the lack of employees with the proper skills , which is an entirely different problem from the Fed is trying to fight with their policies .",NEGATIVE
"With affordability issues heating up , as noted above , we will be watching the CoreLogic home prices indexes with a more careful eye .",POSITIVE
"These reports have showed stronger price growth than either the FHFA or the Case - Shiller data , as noted earlier .",POSITIVE
It will be very interesting to see how these data sets converge over the next month .,POSITIVE
"It is still a little surprising to us that a country the size of Greece , which what one commentator mentioned was about the economic size of Alabama , was moving world markets this much .",POSITIVE
"It does , however , say mountains about Europe 's ability to cope with problems and that there are potentially serious problems with the structure of the eurozone .",POSITIVE
"The short - term drama should settle down soon , but the longer - term structure of the European Union , with disparate countries with different growth rates tied to one rigid currency , could prove to be a real problem .",NEGATIVE
This week Morningstar Investment Management senior economist Francisco Torralba and corporate bond strategist Dave Sekera offered their take on the crisis and Sunday 's referendum .,POSITIVE
"For an interesting editorial on the longer - term context , we also think this editorial by Brett Arends of MarketWatch is worth a read .",POSITIVE
"There was a lot of economic news for the week , but none of the reports were really game - changers .",NEGATIVE
Most of the reports showed a U.S . economy that continued to trudge along with no real acceleration or deceleration in growth .,NEGATIVE
Everything continues to point to 2.0 % - 2.5 % growth .,POSITIVE
"Another reason for the big yawn for this week 's economic data is most economists were very close to the mark on a lot of indicators , which almost never happens .",NEGATIVE
"Auto sales hit 17.2 million units , exactly as analyst forecasts ( which were down month to month and up year to year ) .",NEGATIVE
"Auto industry growth , while nice to have , was n't nearly as strong as it was at the beginning of this recovery .",NEGATIVE
"Employment growth for June also matched the consensus forecast with 223,000 jobs added .",POSITIVE
Some previous months of employment data were also restated lower .,NEGATIVE
All of this brings employment growth and GDP growth into closer alignment .,POSITIVE
"We knew the relative growth rates ( high employment growth , lower GDP growth ) did n't make any sense at the beginning of the year .",NEGATIVE
We expected a big blowout event to bring the numbers back in line .,NEGATIVE
"Instead , we got a slow , irregular drift back down combined with some minor revisions to the employment data .",NEGATIVE
Monthly job growth will need to accelerate sharply in the back half of the year if there is to be any hope of adding as many jobs in 2015 as we did in 2014 .,NEGATIVE
"Job growth would need to accelerate to something like 280,000 jobs per month , on average to get to the 2.9 million or so jobs added in 2014 .",NEGATIVE
"At the moment , that looks like a bit of a stretch .",NEGATIVE
