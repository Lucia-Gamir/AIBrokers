"If the pitch does n’t correspond with the meaning of the word , a conflict is generated : the participants would answer more slowly and make more mistakes .",NEGATIVE

( MENAFN Press ) Integratus Solutions is co-presenting their Data Warehouse Success Story with CP Kelco During a Webcast Coming Up August 19 2015,NEGATIVE
The company offers pre-built Business Intelligence ( BI ) & Data Warehouse ( DW ) solutions to integrate cloud & on - premise data enabling self - service reporting for executives department heads managers & administrators .,POSITIVE
We decided to get together with Ron from Integratus Solutions and learn more about business solutions .,POSITIVE
This interview is free to re-publish .,NEGATIVE
Ron what are some of the top issues you hear when talking to CIO’s ?,NEGATIVE
Without a doubt the number one issue we consistently hear from CIO ’s across the board is how to get information out to the enterprise into the hands of the people who need it to do their jobs on a day to day basis .,POSITIVE
All organizations have invested significant amounts of money in many cases anywhere from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars into their transactional systems to improve efficiency manage their business and capture valuable data on their customers patients financials employees inventory levels and so on .,POSITIVE
Often the first challenge is to ensure employees are adopting and using these systems to consistently & accurately capture the data needed for analytics .,POSITIVE
Once these systems are in place typically for one or two years organizations realize that an enterprise data warehouse platform is required in order to fully realize the value of their disparate internal and external data .,NEGATIVE
As a result - many organizations are investing as much as a 100 million into their data warehouse platform in order to fully realize the value of these investments and achieve competitive advantages whether in operational efficiency cost reduction or finding new revenue opportunities through new product offerings academic research business analysis patient care or other valuable ways to leverage their existing data .,NEGATIVE
Across all industries we consistently hear that the business is not satisfied with their ability to access actionable data needed to do their job effectively .,NEGATIVE
As a result this is # 1 priority for CIO ’s to meet their objectives .,POSITIVE
100 million is a lot for a data warehouse how do organizations typically justify the return on this type of investment in their data strategy ?,NEGATIVE
There are three ways to justify spending funds on a data warehouse strategy .,NEGATIVE
The first is to reduce the cost of data integration .,NEGATIVE
In order to produce a typical enterprise internal or external report it can involve anywhere integrating from 1 to 5 or more data sources .,NEGATIVE
Locating gathering and merging these disparate data sources typically take 90 % of the time needed to produce a report and can take anywhere from several weeks to months .,NEGATIVE
A typical enterprise needs to produce hundreds of reports annually ( for the executives board members regulatory authorities managers etc. ) .,NEGATIVE
A typical data integration cost for each report ( locating gathering merging ) can run anywhere from 20000 to 1 or more .,NEGATIVE
Multiply this number by 100 ( or more ) annual reports and an organizations reporting costs could easily run anywhere from 2M - 10 M / year or higher ( depending on volume and cost per report ) .,NEGATIVE
As a result its easy to see how most businesses are not currently satisfied with the quality of reporting they are currently receiving based on the data that ’s available .,NEGATIVE
The issue is not with the reporting tools or team however specifically with the lack of a data warehouse strategy & effective implementation .,NEGATIVE
An effective data warehouse means the data is located gathered and merged up front enabling the business to write and access their reports directly within the warehouse rather than manually doing this for each and every report request .,POSITIVE
So the first area of cost savings is in the data integration .,NEGATIVE
There comes a point when organizations decide do we keep hiring additional people to manually integrate data and write reports or do we implement a data warehouse and allow these people to focus more on analytics instead .,NEGATIVE
The second are of value is in data quality .,POSITIVE
Its been estimated that poor data quality costs the US economy as much as 3 trillion / year .,NEGATIVE
As an example poor data quality results shipments sent to the wrong location and strategic business decisions being made poorly with inaccurate incomplete data .,NEGATIVE
How much time is wasted in business meetings debating which department has the accurate sales numbers ?,NEGATIVE
When gathering data on financials employees customers and patients data quality is critical and expensive .,NEGATIVE
The third area of value in a data strategy is perhaps the most valuable however very different for each organization .,POSITIVE
Business revenue opportunities abound in fully leveraging available data .,POSITIVE
Organizations such as Facebook Amazon & Google are leading the world in growth & market capitalization based on business strategies that seek maximize value from their available data .,POSITIVE
As another example I spoke with a BI director from an academic health system who was able to fulfill over 400 research requests as a result of their integrated data warehouse .,POSITIVE
There are countless ways to maximize revenue across all industries by fully leveraging available data on customers and employees .,POSITIVE
Organizations who do this will continue to achieve financial stability reduce their risk and achieve high valuations in the future .,POSITIVE
If I ’ve decided to implement a data warehouse strategy what is the best way to reduce overall implementation risk ?,NEGATIVE
As in any endeavor the best way to reduce risk is by relying on professionals with proven experience .,NEGATIVE
They will help provide the guidance needed to get through roadblocks and reduce or eliminate potential pitfalls along the way .,POSITIVE
They ’ll help ensure the right resources infrastructure and executive sponsorship is in place to maximize value of your investments .,POSITIVE
The right professional (s ) can help you hire a team of data integration and reporting experts to achieve your initial objectives and continue to evolve your data strategy over time .,POSITIVE
For different organizations this is done in different ratios of internal and external resources but it is always recommended to start with proven experts and check the references of the specific consultant / new hire you ’re bringing on .,POSITIVE
Seasoned experts with several successful implementations will be able to provide guidance on getting through roadblocks and avoiding potentially disastrous pitfalls .,POSITIVE
What type of successful data warehouse solutions have you seen organizations implement ?,POSITIVE
Recently we ’ve seen a great deal of organizations moving to cloud applications in order to simplify their IT infrastructure and reduce costs .,POSITIVE
Typically these applications satisfy line of business requirements such as HR CRM or other purposes .,POSITIVE
Often these applications may be a third party service which provides data on customer and / or patient satisfaction for example .,NEGATIVE
In any case integrating data from cloud applications requires additional complexity to ensure this data is effectively included as part of a Data warehouse strategy .,NEGATIVE
Often this data is hugely valuable containing employee or customer information .,POSITIVE
Integrating with financials for example can help provide a complete picture on revenue per employee across location division etc .,POSITIVE
As another example one surgeon may have excellent revenue numbers but perhaps lower patient satisfaction / retention numbers .,NEGATIVE
Without integrating these data sets there is critical information that goes missing .,NEGATIVE
We ’ve recently worked with a large enterprise organization diversified across several businesses from paper to chemical manufacturing among others .,POSITIVE
They recently moved to a cloud HR application called SuccessFactors in order to reduce costs from their previous legacy PeopleSoft application .,NEGATIVE
They achieved the initial value desired however wanted to be able to fully leverage this valuable employee data within their robust data warehouse which is supported by the market - share leading Business Objects toolset .,POSITIVE
The data warehouse already was providing valuable insight on their financials inventory and material costs which is captured in their SAP ERP .,NEGATIVE
Their desire was to correlate this data together with employee costs in order to fully achieve their business objectives .,NEGATIVE
They also used ADP for payroll and wanted to incorporate this as well .,NEGATIVE
We leveraged the SAP data services 4.2 toolset in order to bring the data from SuccessFactors & ADP into their on - premise data warehouse conforming with business & data governance standards .,POSITIVE
As a result their department heads are able to easily access and forecast data on complex employee compensation scenarios taking into account financial and revenue data .,POSITIVE
What are the best data warehouse solutions for each industry ?,POSITIVE
There are a great deal of “ prebuilt ” data warehouse and business intelligence applications available in the market for each industry .,POSITIVE
Some important questions to ask include the following :,POSITIVE
Is it agnostic to data sources & vendor ?,NEGATIVE
( i.e. if it ’s a vendor data warehouse how difficult is it to integrate data sources outside of that vendor ’s domain of expertise ),NEGATIVE
Is it comprehensive for your business requirements ?,POSITIVE
( i.e. if it ’s a financial data warehouse how difficult is it to incorporate data from sales HR etc. ),NEGATIVE
Is it flexible to meet your competitive advantages ?,POSITIVE
( i.e. if it ’s the same solution your competitors are using ; how do you address the advantages inherent to your organization ? ),NEGATIVE
Typically vendor ’s solutions are n’t great at integrating data outside their expertise and their objective is to achieve long - term “ lock - in ” with their applications .,NEGATIVE
As a result many organizations prefer to own their own vendor agnostic data warehouse enabling them to achieve independence from any software vendor and change applications more easily if it can help improve efficiency and or reduce cost .,NEGATIVE
Sometimes organizations end up using some type of hybrid approach of industry and / or vendor solutions combined with their own independently developed data warehouse solutions .,NEGATIVE
In any case its important to have a data governance / quality strategy in place to ensure a single version of the truth and reduce complexity .,NEGATIVE
Where is the best place to start ?,NEGATIVE
Typically organizations begin with an initial health check and / or assessment to determine their available data and resources to support a data warehouse initiative .,NEGATIVE
As a result they can focus on the highest priority areas with highest available quality data to achieve an immediate impact .,POSITIVE
This is important to help reduce cost and risk of data warehouse .,POSITIVE
Typically this also includes meeting with business executives to understand the areas of highest priority for the organization in order to align with business objectives for revenue growth operational efficiency financial stability etc .,POSITIVE
Once this is in place typically a first phase data warehouse will focus on a specific subject area ( i.e. finance quality sales etc. ) together with a strategy to extend this platform for future phases .,POSITIVE
This strategy is much better than a big bang approach since it reduces initial timeframes and risk and allows for iteration along the way .,POSITIVE
What makes your offering unique at Integratus ?,POSITIVE

"Tough economic decisions must be made , however uncertain the signs",NEGATIVE
"There is still great uncertainty on both sides of the Atlantic about the approach to raising interest rates and the timing of the first move According to the latest GDP figures , every household in the UK is now £ 850 a year better off than previous estimates suggested By Andrew Sentance Comments Economic statisticians delivered some very positive news this week .",POSITIVE
The UK economy is producing around £ 20 bn more in annual GDP than we previously thought .,POSITIVE
This extra output reflects a more optimistic picture of the economic recovery .,POSITIVE
"Over the past six years , since the recovery began in mid-2009 , the UK economy has grown on average by just over 2 pc a year .",NEGATIVE
"That may not sound much , but it is in line with the other large Western economies .",POSITIVE
"We are in a “ new normal ” , where growth rates cannot be expected to match the performance before the financial crisis , when economies were buoyed up by easy money , cheap imports and over - confidence about the future .",NEGATIVE
"Business and professional services have grown strongly , partly on the back of our ability to sell our skills and expertise abroad According to the latest GDP figures , every household in the UK is now £ 850 a year better off than previous estimates suggested .",POSITIVE
But where has the extra money has come from ?,NEGATIVE
"When the economy recovers from a recession , the businesses and sectors that do best are not necessarily the ones which prospered before the downturn .",NEGATIVE
The financial sector is a good example of this .,POSITIVE
Banking and finance did extremely well from the 1990s until 2007 .,POSITIVE
"But last year the UK financial sector produced 10 pc less than it did in 2008 , even though the economy as a whole is now generating 6 pc more GDP than at the peak of the last cycle .",NEGATIVE
Economic growth over this recovery is coming from other parts of the economy .,POSITIVE
"Business and professional services have grown strongly , partly on the back of our ability to sell our skills and expertise abroad .",POSITIVE
The hi-tech industries are doing very well .,POSITIVE
The UK 's hi-tech industries are doing very well,POSITIVE
The fact that growth comes from new industries and unexpected sources means it takes a while for statisticians to catch up with what has been happening in the real economy .,NEGATIVE
We now have record levels of self - employment .,POSITIVE
It is only when self - employed people file their tax returns and declare their income that we can understand how much they are contributing to the UK economy .,POSITIVE
This is not the first time that economic statistics have been slow to reflect what has been happening on the ground .,NEGATIVE
"In the early 1990s , there was also a belief that the economy was in the deepest , longest recession since the Second World War .",NEGATIVE
"Now we have the full economic data , there is only one year – 1991 – in which GDP fell , despite the perception that the recession dragged on well into 1993 .",NEGATIVE
"Economic policy - makers should not over - react to GDP figures , which are only one element of the data we have to analyse the performance of the economy A few years ago I shared a conference platform with the Chancellor of the Exchequer from that time , Norman Lamont ( now Lord Lamont ) .",POSITIVE
"He commented that when he came to write about his time as Chancellor about 10 years after the early 1990s recession , he did not recognise the economic statistics .",NEGATIVE
Everything now looks a lot better than it did at the time .,POSITIVE
This is not just a problem for former Chancellors writing their memoirs .,NEGATIVE
It is a serious issue for those in charge of economic policy .,POSITIVE
"George Osborne has been widely criticised for presiding over an era of “ austerity ” , in which government spending has been held back and tax increases have had to be implemented .",NEGATIVE
"He has stuck to his guns in reducing the Government ’s deficit , and the figures now bear him out .",NEGATIVE
"In the first year of recovery , before the famous June 2010 “ austerity ” Budget , the UK economy grew by 1.7 pc .",POSITIVE
"Since then , the UK has grown on average by 2.1 pc a year – in other words , “ austerity ” has been accompanied by faster economic growth .",POSITIVE
"Yet in the dark days of 2011 and 2012 , when the euro crisis loomed large , there were concerns that the economy was in danger of falling into a double - dip or even triple - dip recession .",NEGATIVE
"Most of these dips have since been ironed out , with the exception of two very small falls in GDP in 2012 , due to special factors – the extra public holiday to mark the Queen ’s Diamond Jubilee and the unwinding of the boost from the Olympics .",NEGATIVE
The Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) may also have been misled by unreliable GDP figures .,NEGATIVE
"In February 2011 , the MPC came the closest since the financial crisis to raising interest rates .",POSITIVE
Three members ( myself included ) voted for a rate rise and two or three other members were close to joining us .,NEGATIVE
But at the end of January we received a shock set of GDP figures showing a decline of 0.5 pc in the final quarter of 2010 .,NEGATIVE
"Bad weather had contributed to the weakness of the economy , but the figures were much worse than expected .",NEGATIVE
"George Osborne stuck to his guns in reducing the Government ’s deficit , and the figures now bear him out According to the data released this week , the economy actually grew by 0.1 pc in that quarter , instead of contracting .",NEGATIVE
How would the MPC have reacted if they had seen the picture presented by the latest data and not the initial misleading estimates ?,NEGATIVE
We will never know .,NEGATIVE
There are two important lessons we should take from this experience .,POSITIVE
"First , economic policy - makers should not over - react to GDP figures , which are only one element of the data we have to analyse the performance of the economy .",NEGATIVE
"Labour market statistics , business surveys , the signals from the housing market and indicators of consumer spending all provide vital information about how the economy is performing in real time .",POSITIVE
"The housing market gives us a good indication of how the economy is performing Second , economic policy needs to embody a sound , long - term strategy which is not too heavily influenced by short - term economic indicators .",POSITIVE
A long - term strategy appears to be succeeding in getting public finances into better shape .,NEGATIVE
"Where a strategy appears to be lacking , both in the US and the UK , is in the approach to monetary policy .",NEGATIVE
There is still great uncertainty on both sides of the Atlantic about the approach to raising interest rates and the timing of the first move .,NEGATIVE
The decision to raise interest rates after such a long period will never be easy .,NEGATIVE
But independent central bankers need to be prepared to take difficult decisions in an uncertain economic environment .,NEGATIVE
That is their responsibility .,POSITIVE

"Since then , though , it has recovered around half of this fall and , looking ahead , vast share price growth could be on the cards .",POSITIVE

"And , with it having invested £ billions in recent years in marketing and ensuring its products are widely available across the emerging world , Unilever 's brand loyalty is already strong in the developing world .",POSITIVE
"This , combined with a price to earnings ( P/E ) ratio of 19.6 , indicates that Unilever is a very good value purchase at the present time .",POSITIVE

Alex Ellinghausen by Andrew Clark Malcolm Turnbull is now 60 years old .,POSITIVE
"Thirty years ago , during his 30th birthday party , his onetime editor , Trevor Kennedy , told assembled guests : "" We 're here to celebrate Malcolm 's plans to become Prime Minister of the world . """,POSITIVE
"On Monday night , it seemed Turnbull had dramatically advanced those plans – in Australia , anyway .",POSITIVE
"But the question remains whether he has it within him to channel that searing ambition into becoming an effective , even visionary , Prime Minister of an Australia where the ' lucky country ' sobriquet is fast passing its use - by date .",NEGATIVE
"More specifically , has Turnbull changed enough to never again be the impulsive , self - centred individual impatient to take the levers of power ?",NEGATIVE
"Put another way , has Turnbull gone through the sort of soul searching that Robert Menzies undertook from the time he was ignominiously pushed out of the Prime Ministership by his own Party in 1941 , to leading the reconstituted , re-named Liberal Party back to electoral triumph at the polls eight years later .",NEGATIVE
""" John Howard – after Menzies , the most successful politician in the Liberal Party 's history - played a leading role in persuading Turnbull to stay on in Parliament suggests that at the back of many experienced Liberal minds was a possible scenario like the one currently unfolding , "" Andrew Clark writes .",POSITIVE
"Jay Cronan For Turnbull , the time lapse since he so ignominiously lost the Liberal leadership is nearly six years .",NEGATIVE
"But the fact that former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard – after Menzies , the most successful politician in the Liberal Party 's history - played a leading role in persuading him to stay on in Parliament suggests that at the back of many experienced Liberal minds was a possible scenario like the one currently unfolding .",POSITIVE
"In once again entertaining the idea of Turnbull becoming Prime Minister , the Liberals have taken one look at the polls , and apparently decided that retaining Tony Abbott in the top job would mount to a collective suicide pact .",NEGATIVE
"But if they take on Turnbull , they have also decided to swallow deep reservations over his sometimes erratic early performance as Liberal leader , mistrust of his more moderate stance on issues ranging from the republic , to climate change and gay marriage , a wide circle of acquaintances "" on the other side "" , and seething personal animosity towards him among some Liberal MPs .",NEGATIVE
But separating out these issues dilutes the one critical fact about Malcolm Turnbull .,NEGATIVE
He is different .,POSITIVE
"He is by nature a centrist , although the need to keep the Party 's conservative ideologues inside the Liberal tent may obscure this fact in the next few months .",NEGATIVE

"Bruce , who was extremely close to his son , was killed in a light plane accident in 1982 and is buried on a beautiful family property near Scone , NSW .",POSITIVE
"Turnbull 's mother was Coral Lansbury , the English literature academic and novelist .",POSITIVE
Among her works is The Grotto .,POSITIVE
"Amazon , the net - based book retailer , describes it as a novel set in the 1920s spanning "" two worlds : Sicily with its sinister legends and ancient shrines , and Australia where nothing seems impossible for a young , intelligent girl "" .",POSITIVE

"They separated , but the influence of two strong , disparate characters remains in their son .",POSITIVE
"A striking figure Malcolm Turnbull made a splash wherever he went at Oxford University , as a brash young journalist on The Bulletin , as Kerry Packer 's company secretary and corporate counsel , as the man who orchestrated Packer 's successful rebuttal of sensational allegations emerging from the Costigan royal commission , as lead lawyer in the defence of former UK intelligence officer Peter Wright against a failed British government attempt to suppress his book , as an investment banker and investor , initiating some spectacularly successful deals ; and as the driving force behind the Australian Republican Movement .",POSITIVE
"The sense of difference is accentuated by his considerable wealth – according to some estimates , he is worth about $ 120 million – reflected in Malcolm and Lucy Turnbull 's magnificent residence in Sydney 's ultra-exclusive Point Piper .",POSITIVE
He has made his own history and has an appealing streak of independence .,POSITIVE
But a key to understanding Turnbull 's extraordinary rise are his close ties to the media empire of the later Kerry Packer .,POSITIVE
"There , he formed associations with Trevor Kennedy , an early mentor and editor who later became an investment partner ; with Sean Howard , another Packer editor who also became an investment partner ; with Bruce McWilliam , a Packer lawyer who later worked with Turnbull in merchant banking , then for Rupert Murdoch in London ; and with Packer himself .",POSITIVE
"His wife , Lucy , is an able lawyer who is also a philanthropist , author , onetime Lord Mayor of Sydney , and the key counsel to her husband .",POSITIVE
"She is the other half of what is likely to emerge as the city 's – indeed , the nation 's - most powerful couple .",POSITIVE
"Malcolm Turnbull himself is immersed in Sydney 's business , political and arts circles , and has impressive contacts in New York , London , continental Europe and Russia .",POSITIVE

"Wed , Sep 30 , 2015 , 01:39 BST - UK Markets open in 6 hrs 21 mins Why Growth & Income Chasers Need To Check Out GlaxoSmithKline plc , British American Tobacco plc , Marston ’s PLC And Bovis Homes Group plc By Royston Wild | Fool.co.uk – 10 hours ago Today I am looking at four London favourites offering stupendous value for money .",NEGATIVE
GlaxoSmithKline,POSITIVE
Do n't get me wrong : I 'm fully aware that the crushing issue of exclusivity losses across key labels is likely to keep earnings growth elusive at GlaxoSmithKline ( LSE : GSK ) for some time yet .,POSITIVE
"But for more patient investors I believe the business 's leading position in a multitude of health segments , bolstered by massive R&D investment and strong record in getting product from lab to market , should deliver meaty returns in the years ahead .",POSITIVE
"With global healthcare spend galloping higher year after year , the City expects GlaxoSmithKline to rebound from an anticipated 21 % earnings decline this year to punch a 12 % increase in 2016 .",NEGATIVE
Such figures push a P/E multiple of 16.9 times to just 15.3 times for this year -- any reading around or below 15 times is considered great value .,POSITIVE
"And thanks to this solid outlook GlaxoSmithKline has vowed to shell out a full - year dividend of 80 p per share through to the close of 2017 , producing a chunky yield of 6.5 % .",POSITIVE
I fully expect the pills giant to make good on this promise .,NEGATIVE
British American Tobacco,NEGATIVE
"As consumer spending clout in emerging regions heads relentlessly higher , I believe British American Tobacco ( LSE : BATS ) is in great shape to deliver stonking sales growth .",POSITIVE
"These geographies are home to the lion 's share of the world 's smokers , and the London operator has a firm foothold in the market through top - tier labels like Dunhill and Kent .",POSITIVE
"British American Tobacco is committed to bulking up its presence in these territories , and in recent weeks has announced plans to acquire Polish e-cigarette specialists CHIC Group , as well as swallowing up the whole of Brazil 's Souza Cruz .",POSITIVE
"Recent top - line troubles are expected to push earnings 1 % lower in 2015 , but British American Tobacco is expected to bounce back with a 6 % increase in 2016 .",NEGATIVE
The tobacco giant is consequently set to deal on reasonable P/E ratios of 17.4 times and 16.3 times for these years .,NEGATIVE
"But it is in the dividend stakes where the business really sets itself apart , and anticipated rewards of 156.2 p per share for this year and 163.8 p for 2016 yield 4.3 % and 4.5 % correspondingly .",POSITIVE
"Marston 's Although pub operator Marston 's ( LSE : MARS ) continues to report solid progress , the company 's share price keeps on sliding steadily lower , no doubt fuelled by fears over the future impact of the ' living wage . '",NEGATIVE
"But I believe this weakness represents a prime buying opportunity , with the firm 's plans to expand its 1,600 - strong pub portfolio likely to offset the impact of rising costs , while specialist ales demand should also remain solid .",POSITIVE
"The City expects Marston 's to enjoy an 8 % earnings bump for the years ending September 2015 and 2016 , resulting in ultra-cheap P/E multiples of 11.8 times and 10.9 times .",NEGATIVE
And when you factor in projected dividends of 7 p for this year and 7.3 p for 2016 -- yielding an impressive 4.7 % and 4.9 % respectively -- I believe the beer behemoth provides plenty of bang for one 's buck .,POSITIVE
Bovis Homes Group,POSITIVE
"Thanks to the massive imbalance in the UK housing market , I believe shareholder returns at the likes of Bovis Homes ( LSE : BVS ) should continue to impress well into the future .",POSITIVE
"Latest Land Registry data yesterday showed house sales advance 4.2 % year - on - year in August , down from 4.7 % in the previous month but still nothing to be sniffed at .",NEGATIVE
And I fully expect transaction values to keep surging as homebuyer demand outstrips construction activity .,NEGATIVE
"This view is shared by the City , and Bovis Homes is consequently expected to witness a 28 % earnings increase in 2015 , with a 21 % uptick in the following year .",POSITIVE
These numbers will leave the house builder changing hands on P/E ratios of just 10.4 times and 8.7 times for these years .,NEGATIVE
"Meanwhile , projected payouts of 40 p per share for 2015 and 46.9 p for 2016 yield an impressive 3.8 % and 4.5 % correspondingly .",POSITIVE

"By George Saxon Jul 12 , 2015 Luxembourg 's Philippe Torres has told institutional clients that the odds of the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates in September have receded in light of lackluster data from the world 's largest economy and growing uncertainty overseas including the Greek debt crisis and worries over China 's rapidly cooling economy .",NEGATIVE
""" The Greek debt crisis and the potential fallout should the country exit the Euro zone is a far greater threat to the global economy than the politicians would have us believe , "" wrote Guillaume Toussaint , Chief Investment Officer at Philippe Torres in a scheduled client communiqué .",NEGATIVE
The note was issued following the release of the minutes of the FOMC 's ( Federal Open Market Committee ) June meeting .,NEGATIVE
The minutes showed that voting members struck a markedly dovish tone and pointed to a likely delay in the central bank 's timetable for a normalization of monetary policy .,NEGATIVE
""" Most commentators have been predicting the Fed will raise rates for the first time in 9 years at its September meeting but it has always been our belief that the Fed missed the window of opportunity to hike last year , "" explained Toussaint .",NEGATIVE
""" In our view , it 's becoming patently obvious that , while the US economy may be improving there is an undeniable slowing in the pace of that improvement .",NEGATIVE
"Short of another collapse in oil prices , we do n't see any catalyst that could miraculously produce an acceleration in the pace of this recovery , "" he continued .",NEGATIVE

"The shares gained 2 percent to 28.63 euros as of 9:02 a.m. in Milan , giving the company a market value of about 3.7 billion euros ( $ 4.2 billion ) .",NEGATIVE
Yoox agreed in March to buy Net -a- Porter from Cie. Financiere Richemont SA in an all - stock transaction .,NEGATIVE
The combined entity has annual revenue of 1.3 billion euros ( $ 1.5 billion ) and more heft in the market as competition intensifies in Web retailing of luxury goods .,POSITIVE
"Yoox founder Federico Marchetti is the new company ’s chief executive officer , while Net -a- Porter founder Natalie Massenet , who was set to be executive chairman , quit last month .",NEGATIVE
"Richemont , which owns about 50 percent of Yoox Net - a - Porter stock , also gained in early trading .",POSITIVE
"The maker of Cartier watches said earlier full - year profit will be boosted by an accounting gain of 610 million euros to 670 million euros from the transaction , based on Friday ’s closing share price .",POSITIVE

It 's a good time to be reviewing your estate plans .,POSITIVE
"No , I do n't mean that summer is the right time , necessarily , but recent changes to the tax rules on testamentary trusts and estates that take effect Jan. 1 mean 2015 is the year to review strategies .",POSITIVE
"Next month , we will review those strategies and how they have changed .",POSITIVE
"Today , we will tackle one of the biggest challenges in estate planning , and that is successfully passing on registered education savings plans .",POSITIVE
"Other registered plans , such as RRSPs , RRIFs and TFSAs , allow a plan owner to name a beneficiary .",NEGATIVE
"That 's the person or people who would receive the assets in the plan on the death of the owner , who is called the "" annuitant "" in the case of RRSPs and RRIFs .",NEGATIVE
"The beneficiary could also be the estate of the annuitant , either by actually declaring "" estate "" as beneficiary on the plan , or by default , if no beneficiary is named .",NEGATIVE
RESPs are different .,POSITIVE
They do not allow for a beneficiary to be named in the event of death of the subscriber of the plan .,NEGATIVE
That can cause serious complications .,NEGATIVE
Let 's look at the unfortunate jargon that is applied to RESPs .,NEGATIVE
"First , there is no owner , but a subscriber .",NEGATIVE
"That 's the person who sets up the plan and often , but not necessarily , the one who contributes .",POSITIVE
Spouses can be joint subscribers .,POSITIVE
"This is strongly advised as an estate - planning technique , as the surviving joint owner takes over if one dies .",NEGATIVE
"Typically , the subscriber is the parent , parents or grandparent of the child or children the plan is meant to benefit .",POSITIVE
"The government will pay an education savings grant of 20 per cent of the first $ 2,500 contributed per child per year .",NEGATIVE
This is paid in cash into the plan .,NEGATIVE
"Technically , the subscriber and contributor can be different people , but I 'm going to ignore that distinction for our purposes .",NEGATIVE
The children who are designated to receive the benefit of the RESP in the future are the ones who are called the beneficiaries .,POSITIVE
"For estate planning , this means something different than the beneficiary designation on a registered plan or a life insurance policy .",POSITIVE
"In the event the subscriber dies , there is no change of status with the beneficiary child .",NEGATIVE
"However , there is also no automatic or universal method through which the de facto ownership of the plan transfers .",NEGATIVE
The Income Tax,POSITIVE
Act does not prescribe or determine who has the legal right to the plan on the death of the subscriber .,NEGATIVE
Different RESP plans have different rules .,NEGATIVE
"Therefore , the best method is to name a successor subscriber in your will .",NEGATIVE
"In the absence of such a designation , the assets of the RESP will fall into the estate , come under the jurisdiction of the executors and may have to be collapsed .",NEGATIVE
"This would lose the benefit for the beneficiaries ( unless they are also the beneficiaries of the will and the estate ) , and compel a return of the grant money to the government .",NEGATIVE
Growth of the plan would also be taxable to the estate .,POSITIVE
Those are bad outcomes .,NEGATIVE
"Therefore , if you are the subscriber of an RESP , consider first changing the subscriber designation to joint , if you have a spouse .",NEGATIVE
"Then , since both of you could die , it 's still a good idea to have the designation of successor subscriber named in your will .",POSITIVE
"This can be done by preparing a codicil ( an addendum ) to your will , rather than preparing a new will .",NEGATIVE
A grandparent can name the child 's parents ( or even another person ) as successor .,NEGATIVE
It is clearly your intention that the children should ultimately benefit from the plan .,POSITIVE
"Make sure that will still take place , even if the worst happens .",POSITIVE
Dollars and Sense is meant as an introduction to this topic and should not in any way be construed as a replacement for personalized professional advice .,NEGATIVE

""" We are ready to intervene if it will be necessary from a monetary policy perspective , "" Zurbruegg , vice chairman of the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) , told Finanz und Wirtschaft in an interview published on Saturday .",NEGATIVE
""" We made this clear for example after announcement of the referendum ( on potential bailout terms ) in Greece as there were increased safe - haven flows of funds into the franc . """,POSITIVE
The SNB gave rare confirmation in June that it had intervened to weaken a franc whose strength has hamstrung Switzerland 's export - reliant economy .,NEGATIVE
"The SNB in January abandoned efforts to keep the euro above 1.20 francs , sending the Swiss currency soaring .",NEGATIVE
"The euro now trades around 1.0780 francs , its strongest since February but still below the level the SNB once sought to defend .",NEGATIVE
( EURCHF = ),NEGATIVE
"The paper had posted most of the interview on its website on Friday , citing Zurbruegg as saying the SNB will maintain its negative interest rates despite the franc 's dip .",NEGATIVE
"At its last policy meeting in June , the SNB kept its target range for three - month Libor rates at - 1.25 to - 0.25 percent and a 0.75 percent charge on some cash deposits .",NEGATIVE
"In the print version of the interview , Zurbruegg said the worst should be over for Swiss economic growth after the first half of the year .",NEGATIVE
""" We are counting here on recovering global economic growth that should support demand for Swiss products . """,POSITIVE
Zurbruegg laid some responsibility for the franc 's surge on Swiss investors who have sharply scaled back foreign investment .,POSITIVE
""" We thus have to reduce the overall attraction of the franc .",NEGATIVE
"That works only if the market rates fall overall , "" he said .",POSITIVE
"Zurbruegg dismissed suggestions that the SNB put a large part of its foreign currency reserves into a special fund , saying managing reserves was a central part of monetary policy .",NEGATIVE
"He also said the risk that major banks like UBS ( UBSG.VX ) or Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) were too big to fail had not been completely eliminated , noting crisis plans needed improvement .",NEGATIVE
""" More measures are needed to strengthen the Swiss package , especially in the area of equity , "" he said , adding big banks had improved capital ratios when measured by risk - weighted assets but had room to improve when it comes to leverage ratios .",NEGATIVE
"Domestically focussed banks were well capitalised but should be very cautious on lending and interest rate risk , he added .",NEGATIVE
He cited imbalances in the residential property market that made it too early to sound the all - clear on bubble risks .,NEGATIVE

"She cited : "" a substantial body of evidence pointing to the negative impacts of prolonged mandatory detention of asylum seekers "" and "" evidence that there have been numerous sexual and physical assaults in the detention centres "" .",NEGATIVE
Ms Blakey said the decision taken by the $ 32 billion health industry fund to exit its investment in Transfield was ultimately based on financial rather than ethical considerations and came after more than a year of engaging with the company 's management team and directors on the issue .,NEGATIVE
""" Strict confidentiality clauses in Transfield 's government contracts meant the company was unable to answer questions we needed answers to , "" she said .",NEGATIVE
"However a Victorian nurses union is among campaigners that have claimed victory for pressuring HESTA and First State Super , another top 10 industry fund with many nurse members , to sell - out of Transfield .",NEGATIVE
"Other funds that do n't own Transfield shares have taken the step of black - listing them , in line with their stated environmental and social governance values .",NEGATIVE

"It is expected that Transfield will face a grilling from analysts and investors when it hands down its full - year results , for the period ended 30 June 2015 , on Thursday 27 August .",NEGATIVE
"The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors , which represents 30 non -profit super funds managing about $ 400 billion , has been putting pressure on Transfield Services to justify the governance risks associated with its detention centre business for more than a year .",NEGATIVE

Does 3D Systems Deserve Its $ 200 Million Premium Over Stratasys ?,NEGATIVE
3D Systems has had more operational issues and generates less revenue than Stratasys .,NEGATIVE
What gives ?,POSITIVE
"Steve Heller TMFTopDown Jul 14 , 2015 at 7:14 PM",NEGATIVE
"At the time of this writing , 3D Systems ( NYSE : DDD ) is worth about $ 200 million more than Stratasys ( NASDAQ : SSYS ) .",NEGATIVE
"Yet 3D Systems generates less revenue , has a smaller installed base , and has experienced more execution issues in recent years than Stratasys .",NEGATIVE
"It certainly makes you wonder if Mr. Market has behaved irrationally toward 3D Systems , or if the company deserves to trade at a premium over Stratasys .",NEGATIVE
"Justifying the premium Given 3D Systems ' seven distinct 3D printing technologies , investors may believe that its diverse portfolio is ultimately more valuable than Stratasys ' three - technology portfolio .",POSITIVE
"In theory , 3D Systems ' portfolio should allow it to cater to a wider range of 3D printing customers , giving it more revenue - generating opportunities than Stratasys .",POSITIVE
"For instance , 3D Systems technologies can 3D - print with metal , sugar , and ceramic -- all areas where Stratasys does n't compete .",NEGATIVE
"In practice , however , 3D System s ' highly diversified model has begun to fall behind Stratasys ' where it counts : revenue .",NEGATIVE
"What 's more , the Wall Street community does n't expect that 3D Systems will reclaim its status as the largest 3D printing company by revenue in the coming years .",POSITIVE
Sales Estimates $ 896.5 million Source : S&P Capital IQ .,POSITIVE
There are likely two major reasons that analysts believe Stratasys will continue to generate more revenue than 3D Systems in the nearer term .,NEGATIVE
"First , Stratasys ' industrial market share stood at 54.7 % near the end of 2014 , which is significant considering the industrial market is the largest driver of industry revenues .",POSITIVE
"According to Wohlers Report 2015 , 3D printers priced higher than $ 5,000 represented about 8 % of all 3D printers sold in 2014 , but made up nearly 87 % of the industry 's entire revenue for the year .",POSITIVE
"Second , Stratasys has the largest installed base of 3D printers in the industry .",POSITIVE
"At the close of the first quarter , Stratasys had sold a total of 129,197 3D printers across its MakerBot , Objet , and Stratasys brands since their respective inceptions .",NEGATIVE
"This installed base feeds into the company 's razor - and - blade model , paving the way for it to sell consumables -- over and over again during a printer 's life -- typically at higher mark - ups than 3D printing hardware .",POSITIVE
"In other words , Stratasy s ' industry - leading installed base suggests that it 's poised to generate a healthy -- and potentially larger -- stream of recurring revenue than 3D Systems .",POSITIVE
Discounting future growth,POSITIVE
"To capitalize on its growth opportunity , 3D Systems acquired about 50 different companies over the last four years .",POSITIVE
"This acquisition - hungry strategy has given 3D Systems major indigestion , resulting in numerous execution issues and ensuing management shake - ups .",NEGATIVE
"It 's also come at the expense of 3D Systems ' organic growth rate , which measures the rate of annual revenue growth for revenues greater than a year old and helps investors track revenue growth outside of recent acquisitions .",NEGATIVE
"3D Systems ' organic growth rate declined to negative 7 % in the first quarter , meaning that if it were n't for recent acquisitions , the company would 've reported negative revenue growth during the quarter .",NEGATIVE
Source : 3D Systems .,POSITIVE
"To be fair , Stratasys has dealt with its fair share of issues in the last year .",POSITIVE
"Most notably , the company's MakerBot acquisition failed to live up to growth expectations , resulting in management writing down the acquisition value on two different occasions .",NEGATIVE
"Thus far , Stratasys has written off $ 296 million -- 73 % of the $ 403 million it paid for MakerBot -- raising serious questions about management 's ability to create shareholder value from acquisitions .",NEGATIVE
"Beyond its MakerBot troubles , Stratasys ' most recent first quarter also faced currency headwinds , product revenue declines , and softer spending from large customers .",NEGATIVE
It was undoubtedly a challenging quarter for Stratasys .,POSITIVE
But there were encouraging signs that suggest the underlying strength of its razor - and - blade model remains intact :,POSITIVE
The company 's consumable revenue managed to increase by 18 % year over year in the quarter .,POSITIVE
What gives ?,POSITIVE
It 's possible that investors are looking beyond the next couple of years and believe that 3D System s ' jack - of - all trades approach will eventually allow it to command a greater market share than Stratasys in the long run .,POSITIVE
"Even with this assumption , however , investors are failing to consider the quality of 3D System s ' underlying business outside of its technology portfolio .",NEGATIVE
3D Systems ' underlying issues seem more severe -- and more difficult to correct -- than what Stratasys is currently facing .,NEGATIVE
"After all , 3D Systems is tasked with cohesively integrating 50 or so acquisitions under one umbrella , and such integration has historically created many issues for the company , including diverting management 's focus away from its existing operations .",NEGATIVE
"Stratasy s ' most pressing concern has been its MakerBot unit , a business segment that represented only 7 % of its total revenue in the fourth quarter .",NEGATIVE
"Although the corresponding writedowns have not been ideal , the unit 's relative size is n't a make - or - break issue for the company .",NEGATIVE
"It 's also encouraging that Stratasy s ' consumable sales increased by 18 % in the first quarter , suggesting that there 's power behind the company 's large installed base , which could act as a buffer in challenging operating environments .",POSITIVE
"All things considered , it does n't make a whole lot of sense that 3D Systems continues to trade at a premium to Stratasys .",NEGATIVE
This $ 19 trillion industry could destroy the Internet One bleeding - edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed .,NEGATIVE
"And if you act quickly , you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change .",POSITIVE
Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism ...,POSITIVE
"The Economist is calling it "" transformative "" ...",POSITIVE
"But you 'll probably just call it "" how I made my millions . """,POSITIVE

"Adam Collins , an economist with Capital Economics , said the dip in confidence also reflects higher gasoline prices in recent months ; prices hit bottom at $ 2.03 a gallon in late January and have since rebounded to $ 2.70 a gallon , according to AAA .",NEGATIVE
"Consumer caution may reduce spending to an annual growth rate of 2 percent in the July - September period from the 2.7 percent forecast for the April - June period , Collins said in a research note .",NEGATIVE
He predicted their mood will improve .,POSITIVE
"“ With the labor market likely to strengthen further , wage growth poised to accelerate and the recent fall in oil prices suggesting gasoline prices may start to decline again , ” he wrote , “ confidence should rebound soon . ”",POSITIVE

"The Pilbara miner 's raising formally closed on Friday evening and , having secured commitments of $ 74 million as of Wednesday , is expected to fall short of its target .",NEGATIVE
"Atlas undertook the critical raising amid extreme volatility in the iron ore price , which fell from around $ US60 a tonne on the day the company received shareholder approval to raise the equity , to as low as $ US44.59 a tonne about half way through its efforts .",NEGATIVE
"While now recovered to about $ US51 a tonne , the volatility is expected to have hampered investor enthusiasm for the up to 3.6 billion new Atlas shares on offer at 5 ¢ a share , with one free 7.5¢ option attached to each new share .",NEGATIVE
Lead manager on the raising Hartleys said on Wednesday it had secured commitments of $ 30 million from existing shareholders and the general public on top of around $ 44 million from Atlas 's contractors .,POSITIVE
What the miner raises beyond this is expected to be announced on Monday or Tuesday after additional retail commitments are tallied and funds from institutional investors included .,NEGATIVE

"While the outcome of the raising is n't do or die for Atlas , the miner 's short - term viability remains largely tied to iron ore prices , especially in regards to its ability to deal with its towering debt pile .",POSITIVE
"The iron ore price crashed to $ US47 a tonne in early April , pushing Atlas to suspend operations at its three Pilbara mines , a move it has since reversed after striking an innovative profit sharing agreement with contractors including MACA , Qube and McAleese .",NEGATIVE
"The miner is targeting a breakeven price , where it is neither making or losing cash , of $ US50 a tonne by December .",NEGATIVE
It says it is currently breaking even at an iron ore price of around $ US53 a tonne .,POSITIVE
"While this is substantially lower than its costs before it struck the agreement , it remains tensely close to current prices .",NEGATIVE
"Mr Flanagan has said the company has the potential to remain viable for three months if prices plummeted below $ US45 a tonne , a level not out of the question with a number of analysts , including from Citi , expecting the price to slump below $ US40 a tonne by year 's end .",NEGATIVE
Atlas 's $ US269 million Term Loan B debt facility due in December 2017 also looms heavy .,NEGATIVE

"At the beginning of a new Parliament , MPs are assigned a seat in the House of Representatives .",POSITIVE
"In the days of the Rudd and Gillard governments , when the Coalition found itself staring forlornly at the Treasury benches across the chamber , opposition frontbenchers shuffled , bitterly , in to the House , finding it hard to believe where they were sitting .",NEGATIVE
But not all of them .,NEGATIVE
"Bronwyn Bishop , according to one of her colleagues at the time , strutted in with an air of authority well above her lowly portfolio responsibilities : shadow minister for veterans ' affairs ; shadow minister for seniors and , later , shadow special minister of state .",POSITIVE
"As befitted her station , Bishop had been assigned a spot well down the frontbench pecking order , possibly even on the curved benches in the middle of the chamber where junior frontbenchers are consigned .",NEGATIVE
David Rowe,POSITIVE
She was having none of that .,NEGATIVE
"With one eye firmly on where the chamber cameras were positioned , and one on the distance to the despatch box – from which frontbenchers speak and move points of order , she marched up towards the Speaker 's chair , smiled her most terrifying smile at her colleagues , and plonked herself down in a spot among her seniors .",POSITIVE
They all sheepishly made way .,NEGATIVE
And that was where she stayed until the 2013 election .,POSITIVE

It has kept the entitlements issue alive and worked against a behind - the - scenes agreement to cease hostilities lest they bring on a conflagration .,POSITIVE
Entitlements review,POSITIVE
"The issue , of course , wo n't go away .",POSITIVE
"The Prime Minister has called on a "" root and branch "" review of the entitlements system .",NEGATIVE
Bishop still faces investigation and possible action by both the Department of Finance and the Australian Federal Police .,NEGATIVE
"But the unresolvable nature of the MP entitlements debate – which ultimately relies on politicians not abusing the system , or even just a bit of political common sense and will to live – means that it is just as likely to continue to flare from time to time .",POSITIVE
"How do you set up a system that can , without fail , only subsidise politicians for the cost of their official duties , when their diaries are always a messy combination of the "" official "" , the "" party political "" and the "" personal "" , even before politicians get greedy about what they claim ?",NEGATIVE
Parliament 's return next week will be dominated by the process of electing Bishop 's replacement as Speaker and much palaver about parliamentary standards .,NEGATIVE
This will put on display the Prime Minister 's humiliating loss of control over events .,NEGATIVE
"Not only can he not make a Captain 's Pick for Speaker this time round , he has to make a virtue of being at the mercy of his party room in the decision about who gets this plum job .",NEGATIVE
"But this is just a potent symbol of a bigger problem for the Prime Minister and the government , whose policy agenda ( whatever that now is ) is hobbled in every direction .",NEGATIVE
It has all the political room for manoeuvre of a broom cupboard .,NEGATIVE
"The frigates deal is , after all , an attempt to talk South Australia back from the edge of a political cliff .",NEGATIVE
"Having dismissed the state 's concerns in a most cavalier fashion while the future of the car industry and submarine - building program was up for grabs , the government has discovered a newfound interest in all things crow - eater .",POSITIVE
"But in putting this new investment in South Australia , the government has upset Victoria , which will miss out on work at Williamstown .",NEGATIVE
PM naysays IR reform,NEGATIVE
"The Productivity Commission emerged this week with its take on industrial relations reform , only to be marginalised within a couple of hours by the Prime Minister who was keen to reassure voters that the government was n't going anywhere near IR any time soon thanks very much .",NEGATIVE
"The government had actually been making some headway on Indigenous affairs , and looking statesmanlike over the referendum on constitutional recognition .",NEGATIVE
But that also went south when it emerged the PM had rejected a push to construct an Indigenous consensus .,NEGATIVE
Also coming up in the next few weeks is the question of what emissions reductions target the government announces ahead of the Paris climate change talks .,NEGATIVE
The Prime Minister really did n't want to talk about that this week either .,NEGATIVE
And it is hard to believe that – given his general position on climate change – there is anything he can announce that will get any widespread endorsement .,NEGATIVE
Things are complicated for the government too on same - sex marriage .,NEGATIVE
"The thing is , there are things that the government could be promoting as positives .",POSITIVE
But the events of recent weeks mean it has lost the upper hand on even these issues .,NEGATIVE
Consider the Chinese free - trade agreement .,NEGATIVE
Trade Minister Andrew Robb has been out singing its praises .,POSITIVE
He even took on Alan Jones on radio this week .,POSITIVE
"But while the government has been urging the private sector , and particularly agricultural groups , to get out and proselytise on the benefits of the agreement , Robb has been virtually left on his own to defend the deal against Labor accusations that it will open the "" floodgates "" to underqualified Chinese labour .",NEGATIVE
"Senior ministers arguing the case for the deal , and against the accusations about its impact on the labour market , are nowhere to be seen .",NEGATIVE

""" Now they recognise the fact that it 's the first thing the customer touches when they go into a supermarket , "" he said .",POSITIVE
"The major supermarket chains and independent retailers are now upgrading trolleys every three or four years instead of every five to seven years , reducing the number 212 - litre trolleys and adding more 70 - and 100 - litre models to cater to more frequent shopping trips , the growing popularity of self - scanning checkouts and an ageing population .",NEGATIVE

""" Five or six years ago bigger was better – the chains went to 240 litre trolleys because they had feedback from the market the bigger the trolley the more groceries people put in , "" Mr Sully said .",NEGATIVE

"Five years later , when the retailer decided to upgrade its fleet to 212 litres , the Sullys were invited to tender for the job , even though they had no source of supply .",NEGATIVE
""" There was no manufacturer in Australia and the cost of setting up in Australia was far too prohibitive , so we had to go offshore , "" Mr Sully recalled .",NEGATIVE
"After sourcing trolleys from a major supplier in Guangzhou for many years , QHDC established its own manufacturing facility in Suzhou , west of Shanghai , in August last year .",POSITIVE
"The company , Suzhou QHDC Metal Products , now produces between 120,000 and 150,000 trolleys a year , supplying the major grocery and discount department store chains and independent retailers in Australia , as well as other local suppliers and retailers in the United States , Thailand , and Malaysia .",POSITIVE
