"Companies in the resources , commodities and shipping sectors were likely to take advantage of the ruling , Mr Cecil said , given Australia 's status as a "" hub "" for asset holdings .",POSITIVE

BCBC is pursuing its JV partner in the High Court of Singapore .,POSITIVE
"Bayan argued that the Supreme Court of Western Australia had no power to make a freezing order against it , as it related to a prospective judgment of a foreign court and was beyond its jurisdiction .",NEGATIVE
